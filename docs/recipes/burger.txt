Cook the burgers as for a grill, above.
 IF USING A SAUTE PAN OR GRIDDLE (PREFERABLY CAST IRON): Heat the oil in the pan or griddle over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer.
 Cook the burgers until golden brown and slightly charred on the first side, about 3 minutes for beef and 5 minutes for turkey.
